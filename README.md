###Cordova-based Android app to send gps coordinates as an SMS


##Requirements

* Cordova 2.9.x

* Android 3.*+

##How it works

I wrote this after locating friends at a football game with great difficulty. 
Press a button to find your GPS coordinates then search for a person from your 
contacts to send your location to. Send one or more text messages containing a
google maps link of your location.

Never lose your friends again!

Or just buy an iPhone :)
